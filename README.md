*Draw board == DONE
*Piece class with specific types inheriting from this == DONE
*Draw Pieces == DONE
*On mouse click, cycle through pieces and check if collides
*If moved to another square, snap to that square == DONE
*If another piece is on that square, take if other colour, invalidate move if not == DONE
*Create movement rules for specific pieces == DONE
*Create checkmate/pawn promotion rules

TO-DO

*Draw dragged piece on top of other pieces - maybe by initiating it as a separate class or 
moving it in the piece list or by just drawing it twice.

*Re-do hacky passing board to every valid-move check. Either pawn has it's own check or entire 
move validation method is re-done.

*Turn implementation - piece movement relies upon piece being selected before being moved.
